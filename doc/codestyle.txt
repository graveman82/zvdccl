Type Naming
-----------

The type name starts with an uppercase letter and the words are separated using Camel Casing. That is, each new word in class name starts with an uppercase letter. 
For global namespace the "Zvd" prefix is used. This is the common way to name zvd types.

To distinguish between types of same name but in different subsystems (modules) that subsytem short name is used right after the "Zvd" prefix before the base name of type.

For example:

ZvdMathCircle - math description of a circle
ZvdWorldCircle - circle as object in world
ZvdGfxCircle3DF64 - circle render data with double to store coords

Subsystems and modules
