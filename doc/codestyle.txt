Common rules
************
Excluding macros, the words make up an identifier are separated using Camel Casing. That is, each new word in identifier name starts with an uppercase letter. 

************
Type Naming
************

The type name starts with an uppercase letter. All zvd classes in global namespace are prefixed by "Zvd" string. To distinguish between types of same name in different subsystems (modules) in global namespace that subsytem (module) short name is used right after the "Zvd" prefix before the base name of type. This is the common way to name zvd types.

For example:

ZvdMathCircleF64 - math description of a circle with double to store coords
ZvdWorldCircle - circle as object in world
ZvdGfxCircle3D - circle render data

-----------------------
Subsystems and modules
-----------------------

base -- base definitions and utils
math -- math library
world -- world system
gfx -- graphics
gui -- user interface

----------------
Var naming
----------------
Class members are named with "m_" prefix followed base name of member starting with a lowercase letter.

For example,
float m_centerX;
void* m_pData;

Local variables names start with a lowercase letter.

----------------
Function naming
----------------
The names of the class methods all start with a lowercase letter. The getter and setter methods of the member m_memberName are named memberName(getter) and setMemberName(setter). 
The names of the global functions all start with a "Zvd_" prefix.

For example, 
void* Zvd_AllocMem();

----------------------
Third-party extensions
----------------------

Some third-party libraries use the ZvdnnClassName naming convention, which means that the class belongs to a library extending zvd. The nn from the prefix tells you which library the class belongs to. For example, ... .
